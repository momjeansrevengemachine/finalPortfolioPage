  <h2 id="poetry1"> to be loved by a poet </h2>
      <p> is the greatest, softest, most crushing experience known to man. They will destroy the words you loved, bring meaning to the prepositions which once meant nothing. You see bodies with no capitalization and remember me. I turned off auto-caps on my phone years ago and never looked back. (The innate urge for drama.) If one day I turned it back on I think you would be nervous. Of who I’ve become. </p>
  <p>Do you sweat when you think about me? Do you remember when you broke me into pieces to mold me back into the version you wanted? Now the perforations on my body allow me to rebuild faster than ever. You tore me apart seam from seam but I found out what I was made of finally and now I sew myself back together with every word I write.</p>
    <p>To be loved by a poet is to fear your own substance. They will see all of it. You can’t hide your intentions from a writer who looks right through your screen and reads the script notes you thought you could hide. You can direct the show and tell yourself it’s kept you safe but didn’t you know that TV is never real? I will not play your part any more. </p>
    <p>Instead, I immortalize you with the keys under my hand. I wish you still played. I asked you to try for me, to grow with me, but still the piano sits, broken, untuned, waiting for my voice to write a melody to keep us going.</p>
<h2 id="poetry2"> i cut my bangs </h2>
  <p> but they're too short </p>
<p>i cut my eyes so i can't see</p>
    <p>the curls on the floor won't cry for me</p>
    <p>the glasses on the sink can't save me</p>
    <p>can you see me from the ground</p>
    <p>will you cut my hair</p>
    <p>until you rid yourself of me</p>
    <p>i pack the boxes who can't hear me</p>
    <p>the tape stuck to itself won't fix me</p>
    <p>can the dust on the floor</p>
    <p>bring me back down?</p>
    <p>I'm too afraid to leave.</p>
    <p>you play my voice and i almost hear it</p>
    <p>but the ghost in the mirror doesn't know me</p>
    <p>who's haunting who?</p>
    <p>an eye for an eye but you blinded me long ago</p>
    <p>have you seen the inside?</p>
    <p>have you pulled back the layers with your hands</p>
    <p>washed yourself of a nothingness that creates a whole world</p>
    <p>have you seen through the eyes of another or is all you can see the bleeding scars on your surface</p>
    <p>i couldn’t see through the tears of red so i cut my hair and i fucked it up</p>
    <p>and it looks fine but my week is ruined until it grows back out </p>
    <p>and my months are ruined until i outgrow you</p>
    <p>but i’ve cut off all the ends you’ve touched</p>
    <p>it’s softer now without you</p>
    <p>i’m fuller now without you thinning my hair</p>
    <p>without you starving my heart and draining my eyes</p>
    <p>would you stitch them back together</p>
    <p>or is the scar tissue too thick</p>
    <p>would you tie my hair back or are the ends too broken</p>
    <p>maybe i should start cutting my hair with a mirror</p>
  <h2 id="poetry3"> living the midwest gothic </h2>
  <p> driving down a freeway that looks an awful lot like a farmland hellscape, billboards tell you hell is real</p>
    <p>and another mile down is the “gentleman’s club” where you find the entrance, hidden in loose glitter and shoes that defy gravity</p>
    <p>a cheap girl for a good night but another mile down will reminder you that abortion is murder</p>
    <p>control bodies for a dollar and the love of the game</p>
    <p>she only matters after your paid minutes </p>
    <p>if it’s another chance to remind her she’s not in control</p>
    <p>another mile down, budget fireworks</p>
    <p>all celebration must induce fear</p>
    <p>one more mile. guns.</p>
    <p>no requirements, walk in and out with a desire to hurt. no questions asked.</p>
    <p>one more mile. god is real.</p>
    <p>is this an attempt to save us from these last few miles? or a reminder that we’ll never meet?</p>
    <p>why are there so many fucking billboards on country roads anyways. we all know there’s an escape, but nobody takes the next exit </p>
<h2 id="poetry4"> before the world was big </h2>
    <p>When I was younger I wasn’t scared yet. <br>
I knew the world was big; I thought I could take it, make it work in my favor. <br>
Now, I think it might swallow me whole. <br>
When I was younger, I was lonely. <br>
I had friends, mostly. I didn’t know how to be their friend, <br>
I didn’t know how to hold on to love. <br>
Now that I’m older, I’m still afraid to let people in. <br>
The world is so big and I am so afraid of what’s inside. </p>
    <p>When I was 13 I hid under the covers <br>
and tried to find the answers and I’m still looking, <br>
but now, I think I know there won’t be any. <br>
When I was younger I wanted to go home. <br>
Even when I was there. </p>
    <p>
        Now that I’m older I know where home is; <br>
I will not sacrifice <br>
my found family because <br>
the world is so big <br>
but they try to capture it with me.  </p>
    <p>Our house is full of stolen wildflowers</p>
    <p>And maybe, all we need is our corner. <br>
Maybe this is exactly enough. <br>
Maybe this is exactly what I needed</p>
    <p>When I was younger, music felt holy. <br>
It took the emotions I didn’t know I was feeling and brought them to life <br>
and I finally realized it wasn’t just me. </p>
    <p>Before the world was big I was bigger and I thought I could take anything 
and I sure as hell tried. </p>
    <p>
        Now that the world is big. I don’t remember what it was like before. <br>
I wish I could. <br>
I keep searching, chasing my thoughts around my own head, trying to follow a lead into nothingness. 
    </p>
    <p>we don’t talk anymore but together i learned who i am <br>
my world got bigger and so did i<br>
I contain multitudes<br>
have you met the man inside?</p>
    <p>Chase me through the gardens and fall into the universe with me. <br>
Do you know where you are? <br>
Do you know the expanse of the galaxies?</p>
