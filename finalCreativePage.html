  <h2 id="creative1"> everything i learned about myself and the world during study abroad </h2>
  <p> Early January, I left home by myself with one checked bag, one carry-on, and one big-ass backpack. After around 12 hours, two planes with one layover, one train, and one bus, I arrived on campus at the University of Kent in Canterbury, where I moved myself in and lived until April. It’s the middle of May now and I leave for Chicago tomorrow morning. I spent the semester traveling, making new friends, and learning a lot more about myself than I ever expected. I turned 20 in March, and I feel more and less human than ever before. Anyways, here’s the main lessons I’ve learned in the past 5 and a half months. </p>
    <p>Number One: I am so much stronger than I thought</p>
    <p>I spent a month doing solo travel. My trip to the UK was my first ever solo trip. Since the beginning of April, it’s been me, my suitcase, my backpack, and an insane amount of willpower against the world. I’ve run into plenty of hiccups and found myself in some ridiculous situations in that time, including spending an hour and a half lost in the rural Netherlands with no data, all my luggage, and an uncomfortable amount of clothes for the weather (thanks to my limited bag space and poor planning). Despite all of it, I find that I don’t regret a single moment. Sure, I definitely could’ve made some better choices (Mom you can skip over this part) — like maybe not going to an anarchist club in an abandoned warehouse in Milan if I don’t speak any Italian. But in the end, those choices taught me how intensely resilient I am, and how grateful I am to experience the world so purely: unfiltered, authentic, walking the line between brave and stupid.</p>
    <p>Number Two: It's okay to slow down</p>
    <p>I found it tempting to be constantly on the go, telling myself how this trip is once in a lifetime. However, as much as I valued my time out exploring the world, I quickly learned that my body can only keep up for so long. I enjoyed myself more when I slept without alarms, even if that meant never waking up before noon. A slow morning spent making myself coffee and breakfast, journaling on the balcony, was savored much more than any rushed morning forcing myself out to the first task of the day. I’ve never been good at mornings, but the time my day starts has no bearing on the value of that day. Particularly in European cities, where most places are open later than in America, I was happy to find my functional hours between 12pm and 2am. Some of my best days were waking up with the sunlight and the birds, spending a few hours at a museum, and a few more with a coffee and a book in the park. The capitalist push for productivity and my own internal drive to be ‘the best’ has led to keeping myself constantly busy, but the peace I’ve found in a slow day is greater than any sense of accomplishment found in overworking oneself.</p>
<p>Number Three: The world is still here. It is so big and so so small.</p>
    <p>On a similar note, I don’t have to do everything at once. I’ve had to remind myself over and over that at the end of the day, I’m only 20, and the world will still be here. There is still so much more for me to see, I can always come back. It’s not too late. It’s never too late — for exploration, for love, for authenticity. Taking my time, taking pieces of each place I travel, has made me happier and truer to myself. For years I tried to be the person I thought I should be, the golden child, but being myself is just as good. I am not inherently flawed, I am human. I am so happy to be human. I make so many mistakes because I am 20 years old and I know everything and nothing all at once. But in the end, I love, and I am loved, and I can ask for no sweeter kindness from the world. There is so much more for me to see; I could live forever and never be done exploring and learning. Yet each new adventure I go on, I find that at the core, nothing is terribly distant. Every place I go, we are all trying our best to be human, to love and to last. Last month, I traveled to Valencia, Spain on my own. I went on a date with someone from the UK, who spent the last fall in my hometown of roughly 14,000 people. I’m not usually one for destiny, but that moment of connection, of understanding, made me feel so much less alone. We spent 3 days straight together, and I see them again while they visit the US next month.</p>
    <p>Number Four: I am changing so much, so fast</p>
    <p>Looking back at the person I was only a year ago, I am amazed to see the difference. Last spring, during my second semester of freshman year, I went through a depressive episode that sent me home from college every weekend, to change my major (completely — from Biology, pre-med, to English), and back to therapy. I felt lost and unsure of who I was, but it was worth getting to the other side. Getting back to therapy and changing my degree has made me happier and more confident. Giving myself space to grow, I’ve come into myself, and I’m still unsure about a lot of things, but I’m not afraid of that uncertainty anymore. I’ve been writing a lot more in the past year, and going through that work has shown me the arc of who I’ve become. Embracing my work as a poet, I’ve found an outlet that lets me process my emotions in a tangible way. I am a completely different person than I was only a year ago, and chances are, I’ll feel similarly in another year. Change is scary. The unknown is scary. But I am so glad I’m changing. Why would I want to stay the same if I am hurting?</p>
    <p>Number Five: New friends are great, but the old friends that never stop reaching out are irreplaceable.</p>
    <p>When I came to the UK, I knew one other person in my study abroad program. I’m so glad to have her, and we’ve grown closer throughout the semester, having taken a class together and traveled together. However, that means I had to build a whole new network of people — something I’ve really struggled with. Making new friends is very stressful to me, I’ve never felt like it comes easily. Regardless, I found groups of people who I really care about, and now I have people spread across the world who are willing to welcome me into their home any time I want to visit. I’m glad that I stepped out of my comfort zone, both for the sake of learning how to make new connections, and the friendships that have resulted. Even with the love I’ve found abroad, I’ve come to cherish the friends and family back home even more. My roommates found, signed the lease, and moved into our new apartment while I’ve been gone, and now its waiting, ready for me when I return. When I get in tomorrow, I’m making dinner for my friend’s birthday. He texts me every day and sends me poetry. I am infinitely grateful for his love. I’m not a great texter. But I message my friends and family when I can, and call to check in, and they tell me they love and miss me. People I wasn’t terribly close with before tell me they’re looking forward to my return and my heart aches as I am known and loved. Opening myself up to being known is terrifying, but I am so glad I did. Letting love in is the greatest risk we could ever take.</p>
    <p>Number Six: Tell everyone you love them</p>
    <p>I love with so much intensity that it’s exhausting. But I can say with certainty that I would rather feel too much than nothing at all. We are capable of holding so much love in our hearts, and to keep that secret is a complete loss. I’ve thought a lot about the quote from Call Me By Your Name, “Is it better to speak or to die?” recently. Often, I am tempted to say it is better to die. It is so much easier. Admitting our feelings opens us up to hurt. My friends taught me the way it opens us up to love as well. I think I’ve finally decided that the joy is worth the pain. It is better to speak. What else could I ever do as a poet? My words are my greatest power. To silence myself is to give in to the messages of the enemy, to listen to the oppressors who know that you cannot fight back without your words. Silence is complacence. Tell everyone you know that you love them. Tell your friends, I don’t care if you aren’t usually affectionate. Tell your mom. She needs to hear it. Above all, tell yourself. Fill your body with the compassion you extend to others for once.</p>
    <p>Number Seven: I'm glad I exist</p>
    <p>This might’ve been the hardest lesson. I’m not sure exactly what I believed before, really. For a time, I didn’t want to exist — not that I was suicidal, but rather that the world felt so heavy that it seemed much better to Not Be. Maybe it would be nice to be a tree, or a bird instead. Maybe a cloud, just to observe the lives of others without having to get involved. But I would have missed out on so many experiences! A cloud could never write poetry in a museum, a bird could never go on fruitless first dates, a tree could never self-actualize walking home in the middle of the night. Nature is beautiful but it cannot read poems about sharing oranges with your friends, it cannot write over and over in the margins, “I love you, I’m glad I exist.”</p>
