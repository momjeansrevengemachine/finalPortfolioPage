  <p> My mom was always a big reader. She encouraged me and my sister to read as much as possible. Her reward system was perfect. If we finished a book, my sister got a candy bar — I got another book. This quickly became an expensive system, and I soon found myself living in the corner of the public library, huddled up on a chair with a novel much too big for my small frame. I became Matilda incarnate, tearing through every book in the stacks, jumping up grade levels when the young readers’ content began to bore me. I found my first home in the Hempfield Public Library. The second library found me when I moved houses, Pennsylvania to Indiana, when I started 5th grade. A new house, new school, and I found my new home in the Westchester Intermediate School Library. </p>
    <p>This move was a turning point in a lot of ways. I was the new kid, I was growing up, I was starting to understand who I was. It took a while, but I learned through the shelves, and I learned through the kind souls of my school librarians.This was around the time that I started to register there was something different about me. In elementary school, I was in the gifted program. I was different in a good way, but as everyone started to grow up, ‘good-different’ blended into ‘weird-different’. I hadn’t pinpointed why, but what I did know was that the characters I met hidden in the shelves only believed in ‘good-different’. Growing up queer and neurodivergent in a conservative small town, there wasn’t a lot of space made for the weird kids. The library was one space that never failed me. I read about characters who thought like me, who learned like me, and who loved like me. It’s hard to be alone in a room of thousands of people like you.</p>
    <p>Later, in college, I had come into my identity further. I came out to friends and family, and I began to learn what neurodivergence looked like for me. I read the stories of those like me, and the theories of those unlike me. Without access to those resources, I could have easily taken decades longer to both learn about myself, and feel comfortable in myself. What I want to take from this program is the ability to turn access and information into power and safety. I want to be the safe haven that raised me– I want to be the person I needed growing up. Libraries taught me about myself and about the world, and I want to extend that grace throughout my community. With an end goal of public librarianship, I want to, in the wise words of Cesar Cruz, “comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable.” My goal is to offer grace to those who need it, and offer information to those who think they don’t. The public library raised me, and it is my turn to be the mother for my community.
