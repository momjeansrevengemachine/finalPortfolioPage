  <h2 id="academic1"> admissions essay </h2>
  <p> My mom was always a big reader. She encouraged me and my sister to read as much as possible. Her reward system was perfect. If we finished a book, my sister got a candy bar — I got another book. This quickly became an expensive system, and I soon found myself living in the corner of the public library, huddled up on a chair with a novel much too big for my small frame. I became Matilda incarnate, tearing through every book in the stacks, jumping up grade levels when the young readers’ content began to bore me. I found my first home in the Hempfield Public Library. The second library found me when I moved houses, Pennsylvania to Indiana, when I started 5th grade. A new house, new school, and I found my new home in the Westchester Intermediate School Library. </p>
    <p>This move was a turning point in a lot of ways. I was the new kid, I was growing up, I was starting to understand who I was. It took a while, but I learned through the shelves, and I learned through the kind souls of my school librarians.This was around the time that I started to register there was something different about me. In elementary school, I was in the gifted program. I was different in a good way, but as everyone started to grow up, ‘good-different’ blended into ‘weird-different’. I hadn’t pinpointed why, but what I did know was that the characters I met hidden in the shelves only believed in ‘good-different’. Growing up queer and neurodivergent in a conservative small town, there wasn’t a lot of space made for the weird kids. The library was one space that never failed me. I read about characters who thought like me, who learned like me, and who loved like me. It’s hard to be alone in a room of thousands of people like you.</p>
    <p>Later, in college, I had come into my identity further. I came out to friends and family, and I began to learn what neurodivergence looked like for me. I read the stories of those like me, and the theories of those unlike me. Without access to those resources, I could have easily taken decades longer to both learn about myself, and feel comfortable in myself. What I want to take from this program is the ability to turn access and information into power and safety. I want to be the safe haven that raised me– I want to be the person I needed growing up. Libraries taught me about myself and about the world, and I want to extend that grace throughout my community. With an end goal of public librarianship, I want to, in the wise words of Cesar Cruz, “comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable.” My goal is to offer grace to those who need it, and offer information to those who think they don’t. The public library raised me, and it is my turn to be the mother for my community.

  <h2 id="academic2">Freedom and Sexuality in 19th Century Russia</h2>
  <p> In Chernyshevsky’s theory of progress, he argues for rational egoism, or the belief that humans will only act in rational ways which are in favor of their own self-interest. In “What is to be Done?” he writes of a utopia with a goddess of equal rights who claims, “As for woman — before me she was so pitiful. She was a subordinate, an enslaved creature, living in fear; before me she knew too little about the nature of love.” He argued that while women were previously unfree in their lives, particularly in romance, they will, in the future, be able to love freely. He believes in the potential for a utopia, but as seen through the lens of Tatyana in Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin (1833), Liza in Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground (1864), and Nadyezhda Fyodorovna in Chekhov’s The Duel (1891), that goal is far from achievable- little progress has been made, their freedom remains an illusion, and they are treated as commodities to be bought and sold. </p>
  <p> The title character’s love interest, Tatyana Larin, acts as the framework for his “subordinate, enslaved” woman. As she finds herself falling in love, “She yields without conditions, boldly/ As sweet and trusting children do” (Pushkin 69). Tatyana is young, naïve, and as suggested, knows little of love. She quickly falls for him and passion develop rapidly and dramatically over a man whom, at this point, she had never spoken to. She tells her nanny she is “in love, not ill” (Pushkin 66), but despite this, spends the night feverish and unable to sleep. She feels lovesick, and her knowledge of romance comes only from the books she spends hours reading. Because of this, she idealizes these situations, but still does not know true love in her own life. She chases after a man that seems to be unattainable, but when he finally loves her back, she has moved on and married, saying “And happiness was ours… so nearly! / It came so close! … But now my fate/ Has been decreed” (Pushkin 210). Tatyana’s life was predetermined by her class- her fate was decreed. She was expected by her family to marry young and rich, so she chose her best contender and worried herself sick in an attempt to get him to love her back. Tatyana fulfilled her duties as a woman by marrying someone societally acceptable, but this is far from being able to love freely. She is subordinate to social expectations, had little agency over her own life, and is, as the goddess of equal rights would say, a pitiful woman. </p>
<p>Post Chernyshevsky’s progress theory, he believed that there would be a utopia in which women have gained agency over their own bodies and lives and are able to love freely. One of the first characters following the publication of his theory was Liza, in Notes from Underground- Dostoevsky’s response to “What is to be Done?”. Liza is a prostitute in the brothel that the Underground Man and his classmates pay a visit to. Her introduction is vague- only that there is a woman, and the Underground Man approaches her, and the scene fades to black with the implication that they have slept together- a reflection upon how her humanity is viewed. From the start she is framed as an object for sex. Immediately, Dostoevsky places judgment on her for committing the sin of premarital sex. However, when the two begin talking, it becomes apparent that this was far from her choice of a living. At first, when asked why she doesn’t live with her parents, she responds only with “Just because…” (Dostoevsky 62), but upon further discussion, reveals “some are glad to sell their daughters, rather than let them marry honorably” (Dostoevsky 67). Her father sold her into sex work, and she will never be able to buy herself out. She is, effectively, enslaved- just as Chernyshevsky argued would no longer happen. The Underground Man is acutely aware of this as well, and he tells her, “In any case, after a year your price will be lower” (Dostoevsky 64). The longer she is there, the less chance she has to escape because the older girls earn less. She was fated to a life of struggle and poverty from the day her father sold her- but despite this, outsiders judge her for choices which were not made freely, but for her, as a result of hierarchical systems of power which weaponize generational poverty. As her character develops, it is evident that she believes the lectures of the Underground Man and wants to escape and live as a Romantic heroine, living freely. She goes to the Underground Man’s home and tells him, “I want to… get away from… that place… once and for all” (Dostoevsky 84). He is her only chance of leaving the brothel because she must pay her way out, and cannot afford to do so, and no one else has stayed to talk to her- only the Underground Man, who is fulfilling his superiority complex by ‘saving’ this young girl. Even if he were able to get her out, she would not truly be free, only reliant on a different man. Still, Liza is enslaved in her life and unable to love freely.</p>
    <p>Even later is Chekhov’s Nadyezhda Fyodorvna, in The Duel, published 27 years later. Her introduction is similarly grim- her first mention is her lover Laevsky in distress because he feels that he needs to run away from her. Just as Liza was trapped by financial means, Laevsky is hesitant to leave Nadyezhda because she is completely financially dependent on him. It is his duty to take care of her, “Because [he] took her away from her husband and made [himself] responsible for her” (Chekhov 9). Chekhov’s narration implies that Nadyezhda has little control over her own life- she was taken away from her husband, and her lover must support her, but has no desire to. Not only this, but the police captain has also been meeting with her in secret. “She had on two occasions in Laevsky’s absence received a visit from Kirilin… her youth was passing and being wasted… she felt nothing but desire” (Chekhov 26). Nadyezhda feels sexually unfulfilled by Laevksy, even though she is already away from her actual husband. She cheats on him because she fears she is wasting her youth- similar to how Liza was in danger of not making enough money because older girls at the brothel were paid less. Despite her sexual promiscuity, she found no love in any of these relationships. There is no reciprocation of her feelings with Laevsky, and “she felt she was to blame” (Chekhov 25) for his disappointment in their relationship because he had come to the Caucus with her instead of living in St. Petersburg. She is not responsible for his faults- he made the choice to leave and start a relationship, knowing that she was a married woman, but he refuses to take responsibility for his actions. With Kirilin, she used him only as an escape from the disappointment she faced from Laevksy. However, it seems that while their relationship may have started consensually, she is no longer comfortable with it, with Kirilin demanding, “if you do not give me an interview this evening, I’ll make a scandal this very evening” (Chekhov 65). He used her for sex, just as Liza was used for her body. Despite this, she still is enslaved in these relationships due to financial dependency.
</p><p>Through the lens of Tatyana, Liza, and Nadyezhda, contrary to Chernyshevksy’s theory of progress, little has changed for women. They have no agency over their sexuality- it is instead weaponized against them. Tatyana was clueless in love and followed the societal expectations for women of her class. Liza was forced into sex work and was shamed for a career she could not escape. Nadyezhda was unhappy in all her relationships but left trapped by finances. Following his theory, the most noticeable issue in relationships was the disconnect between sex and love- not that sex without love should be demonized- but these women were unhappy in their lives. Between Liza and Nadyezhda, the narration changed to be less judgmental; Nadyezhda was not necessarily shamed for skipping between men, as she was unsatisfied, but this didn’t make her any happier. The men in her life use her either for sex or status, but still, she is helpless without them, with no money to her name, and unable to get a job. Dostoevsky’s narration called Liza dirty and shameful for her work, and the Underground Man made it his mission to change her, fix her somehow- even though her constraints were largely financial, something he did not have the means to help with. But regardless of the narration between these two women, they were equally unhappy and trapped in their lives.
For each of these women, freedom was an illusion, the guise under which they remained subservient. The Underground Man tried to convince Liza to leave the brothel and live her life free as a Romantic heroine, but they both know it is not possible. She is indebted to the brothel, and it is her only chance of making money. Dostoevsky criticized Liza, using the Underground Man to push morals on her. Nadyezhda is first freed from her husband, but then she is trapped in a life with Laevsky. Even when she meets with Kirilin, he is only another obstacle to her freedom, threatening her with scandal. Chekhov presented Nadyezhda just as she was, plainly, and without judgment, but her character revealed freely that she was lost in her relationships. Before, with Tatyana, she was free to choose a suitor to marry, but she was expected to marry young and to a high-class man. Her freedom was limited- women are to be given just enough freedom to call them hysterical if they ask for more. Their sexuality is demonized; women are only free to be sexual when it profits men, and even still, society will judge them. They are a commodity- something to be bought, sold, and traded about, passed between men who can hold them captive with finances, but are not truly free to make their own decisions.</p>
    <p>Chernyshevsky’s theory of progress was optimistic to the level of ignorance. He was correct in saying that women often ‘lived in fear’ and ‘knew little of the nature of love,’ but this did not change years after his publication. Tatyana, Liza, and Nadyezhda Fydorovna were all treated as commodities. They did not have the chance to learn the nature of love. Each of these women understood relationships as transactions, each held in a situation which ties them down due to societal expectations and implications of wealth. The only change made over time was the judgment passed on women. By Chekhov’s time, the judgment was less harsh, but the conditions themselves did not improve. There is no utopia, and the goddess of equal rights has yet to save everyone. The opportunity and ability to love fully and freely is still highly sought after today and was far from the reality for the characters of Dostoevsky and Chekhov. Chernyshevksy’s theory of progress claimed a utopia that none of these characters were in reach of, they were instead trapped by the confines of unhappy relationships.</p>
